            <b style="font-size: larger; "> 
                We all have those days when there are a million 
                things to do, and we don't know how we're going 
                to get it all done. It's easy to become overwhelmed 
                by the vast quantity of tasks that we must do from day
                to day. Sometimes we have so many balls in the air,
                that we may even lose track of some loose ends and 
                forget to do important things. When we get too busy,
                we end up feeling like we are barely able to keep our
                heads above water. </b>

            <h4> Organization</h4> </b> 
            <p style="margin-left: 10px;">One of the most important reasons for keeping a to-do
            list is the organization. Organizing your tasks with a list
            can make everything much more manageable and make you feel 
            grounded. Seeing a clear outline of your completed and uncompleted 
            tasks will help you feel organized and stay mentally focused.</p> 
            <br>

            <b style="font-size: larger; "> 
            <h4>Improved Memory</h4> </b>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Feeling forgetful? Nobody is capable of
            remembering everything at all times. To-do lists are a useful external
            memory aid that give you permission to forget. As long as you can
            remember to look at your to-do list, you will never lose anything
            that you have recorded on it.</p> 
            <br>

            <b style="font-size: larger; "> 
            <h4>Productivity</h4></b>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px;">If you record all your tasks in a to-do list,
            you can easily review the list and prioritize the most important tasks.
            Why waste time on trivial activities when there are important matters
            that need your attention? One study, conducted by the Harvard Business
            Review, showed that 90% of managers wasted valuable time through poor
            time management. Your to-do list will help you focus your attention
            on the most important task of the moment.</p>
